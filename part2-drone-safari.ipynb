    "# Wild Drone LLM Workshop: Part 2 - Drone Safari Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Part 2 of the Wild Drone LLM Workshop! Now that you understand LLM fundamentals, let's build something more exciting - an AI agent that can play the Drone Safari game using natural language commands!\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Game-Playing Agents**: Building agents that can control complex systems\n",
    "2. **Natural Language Control**: Converting human commands to robot actions\n",
    "3. **State Management**: How agents track and respond to changing environments\n",
    "4. **Agent Specialization**: Creating domain-specific AI agents\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Drone Safari Game\n",
    "\n",
    "The drone safari game is a grid-based game where you control a drone to photograph wildlife. Here are the rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective:\n",
    "Photograph all three animals (zebra, elephant, oryx) without crashing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Game Rules:\n",
    "- Don't crash into trees or fly outside boundaries\n",
    "- Don't get too close to animals (they'll get scared!)\n",
    "- Take pictures from exactly 2 cells away in the direction you're facing\n",
    "- You only have 5 pictures total - use them wisely!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Available Actions:\n",
    "- `move(direction)` - Move forward, left, right, or back\n",
    "- `turn(direction)` - Turn left or right  \n",
    "- `take_picture()` - Take a photograph\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by setting up the environment and exploring the game!"

    "## Congratulations!\n",
    "\n",
    "You've successfully built a complete LLM-powered drone safari agent and explored multi-agent systems!\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You've Learned in Part 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Game-Playing Agents**: How to build agents that can control complex systems\n",
    "2. **Natural Language Control**: Converting human commands to robot actions\n",
    "3. **Agent Architecture**: Building agents with specialized system prompts\n",
    "4. **State Management**: How agents track and respond to changing environments\n",
    "5. **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Strategic planning + execution separation\n",
    "6. **Prompt Engineering**: The key to controlling agent behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prompts are Everything**: The system prompt defines your agent's personality, capabilities, and behavior\n",
    "2. **Tool Integration**: LLMs become powerful when connected to external tools and APIs\n",
    "3. **Agent Specialization**: Different agents for different tasks (planning vs. execution)\n",
    "4. **Natural Language Interface**: Users can control complex systems with simple commands\n",
    "5. **Iterative Improvement**: Agent behavior improves through prompt refinement\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "The techniques you learned apply directly to:\n",
    "- **Autonomous drones** and robot swarms\n",
    "- **Smart home** and IoT device control\n",
    "- **Customer service** and support bots\n",
    "- **Process automation** and workflow management\n",
    "- **Research assistants** and data analysis tools\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Experiment** with different prompts and personalities\n",
    "- **Add new tools** and capabilities to your agents  \n",
    "- **Try real APIs** (weather, maps, sensors) instead of mock data\n",
    "- **Scale up** to more agents and complex coordination\n",
    "- **Apply to real robotics** and drone systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep experimenting and building amazing AI systems!"
