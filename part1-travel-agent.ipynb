    "# Wild Drone LLM Workshop: Part 1 - Simple LLM Travel Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Part 1 of the Wild Drone LLM Workshop! In this notebook, you'll learn the fundamentals of Large Language Models (LLMs) and build your first AI agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **LLM Fundamentals**: How LLMs work and their capabilities\n",
    "2. **Tool-Calling Agents**: Building agents that can interact with external tools\n",
    "3. **Agent Architecture**: Understanding system prompts and agent design\n",
    "4. **Practical Application**: Creating a weather-based travel planning agent\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workshop Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Setup and Installation**: Configure your environment and API keys\n",
    "- **LLM Basics**: Understand how language models work\n",
    "- **Tool Calling**: Learn to give LLMs \"superpowers\" with external functions\n",
    "- **Travel Agent**: Build a complete travel planning assistant\n",
    "- **Experimentation**: Modify prompts and tools to see how agents behave\n",
    "\n",

    "Before we begin, let's install the required libraries and set up our environment.\n",

    "### API Key Setup (Required!)\n",
    "\n",
    "You need a **Gemini API key** to run this workshop. Get one free from: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommended Setup:**\n",
    "1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`\n",
    "2. Add your API key: `GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_key_here`\n",
    "3. The notebook will automatically load it securely\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternative:** Set environment variable in your terminal:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_key_here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security Note:** Never commit API keys to version control! The `.env` file is already in `.gitignore`."
