    "\n",
    "Welcome to an exciting journey into the world of Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI agents! \n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop, you'll learn:\n",
    "1. **LLM Fundamentals**: How LLMs work and their capabilities\n",
    "2. **Tool-Calling Agents**: Building agents that can interact with external tools\n",
    "3. **Game Automation**: Creating an LLM agent to play the Drone Safari game\n",
    "4. **Multi-Agent Systems**: Building coordinated AI agents that work together\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workshop Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 1: LLM Fundamentals & Simple Tool-Calling Agent\n",
    "- Understanding LLMs and their capabilities\n",
    "- Building a simple weather-based travel agent\n",
    "- Learning about tool calling and function execution\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2: Drone Safari Game Agent\n",
    "- Creating an LLM agent to play the game using natural language\n",
    "- Implementing tool calling for game actions (move, turn, take_picture)\n",
    "- Testing and refining the agent's performance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 3: Multi-Agent System (Advanced)\n",
    "- Building a strategic planning agent\n",

    "You need a **Gemini API key** to run this workshop. Get one free from: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommended Setup:**\n",
    "1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`\n",
    "2. Add your API key: `GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_key_here`\n",
    "3. The notebook will automatically load it securely\n",
